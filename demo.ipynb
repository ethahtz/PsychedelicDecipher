      " , @xmath79 is the time , @xmath80 are the pauli spin matrices .    using eqs . \n",
      " ( [ spincorr ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , we find that the long - wavelength correlation function falls off as @xmath81 . \n",
      " this exponent is the same as the one computed by single - spin perturbations studied in ref .   and can be motivated by simple dimensional counting . \n",
      " this proves the existence of the asl in the kitaev - hubbard model . \n",
      " although the prefactor is extremely small for large @xmath4 ( @xmath82 ) , this is the leading behavior at long distances . \n",
      " therefore the effect of the perturbation can not be neglected for any value of @xmath4 , however large . \n",
      " indeed , we can expect the strength of these correlations to grow as @xmath4 decreases .    \n",
      " thus , at large @xmath4 , the leading order contribution to the spin susceptibility is independent of @xmath4 as in the kitaev model , whereas the next order contribution goes as @xmath83 . \n",
      " the @xmath4 dependence of the spin susceptibility will hence be of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants independent of @xmath4 . \n",
      " experimental methods for measuring the spin susceptibility in cold atom systems have recently been developed  @xcite . \n",
      " the value of @xmath83 , for the lowest values of @xmath87 that the asl exists , ranges from @xmath88 , depending on @xmath16 . \n",
      " thus , susceptibility measurements as a function of @xmath4 , with an accuracy of about @xmath89 , can provide evidence for the existence of the asl in this model .    \n",
      " the stability of the asl in this model comes from the preservation of tr symmetry . \n",
      " we have investigated the possibility of spontaneous breaking of tr symmetry and the consequent emergence of a chiral spin liquid ( csl ) with a spinon gap ( see supplemental material ) . in the fermionized version@xcite of the effective spin model , where @xmath90 , we use a mean - field theory in which the vison and the spinon sectors are decoupled . \n",
      " this mean - field theory is exact for the kitaev model , which is obtained by putting @xmath25 in @xmath91 . \n",
      " we find that the csl solutions occur only for @xmath92 and for @xmath93 and , thus , are not seen in the mott regime @xmath94 . in fig .  \n",
      " [ fig : gap ] , we plot the spinon gap as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath29 .     for @xmath25,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in conclusion , we have shown that the kitaev - hubbard model shows a mott transition from a semi - metallic phase to an algebraic spin - liquid phase . \n",
      " the former breaks time - reversal symmetry whereas the latter preserves it . \n",
      " the asl is stabilized by tr symmetry . \n",
      " we have proved the tr invariance in the mott phase ( to all orders in @xmath14 ) , using charge - conjugation symmetry . at intermediate @xmath4 , \n",
      " the asl phase occurs for a wide range of @xmath16 , which narrows down as @xmath4 is increased . \n",
      " concrete schemes to realize this model have been proposed@xcite , and experimental methods to probe the semi - metal at low @xmath4 values@xcite and the asl at large @xmath4 values @xcite exist . \n",

      "I saw her walk through the crowded hallways everyday.  The way the light glistened off her caramel skin had me star struck.  Her beautiful face astounded me as it went perfectly with her intriguing light brown eyes.  The days went by slowly and I still couldn’t muster up the courage to walk her way.  To her I was a shadow among shadows, invisible to her and so many others.  The world worked in many awkward ways I guess, because this particular day was my lucky day.  Lacy was in my algebra 2 class, and being smart actually came in handy for once.  I overheard Lacy and Mr. Tate talking he told her that she was flunking and the only way she could pass the semester is passing our upcoming exam.  This was my chance, maybe the only once in a lifetime chance you get when you find that special one. “Hey Lacy you might not know me but I’m Bret I’m in your algebra 2 class and I couldn’t help but hear about your problem.” I said “Oh so you heard. I’m terrible at this stuff I just don’t get it.”  “Well um maybe I could ugh tutor you sometime.”  “That would be great! What did you say your name was again?” “Oh I’m um Bret, Bret Johnson.  How about I pick you up say around 5:30 from your house I have brand new camaro and I just put in a new engine, been wantin to test it all week.” “Wait you have a camaro I have wanted one of those forever, I kind of love cars fixing them just about anything to do with them.”  “Wow really, me too.  So 5:30.” “Yeah see you then and thanks.” “No problem anytime.”  I watched intently as she walked away, her jeans were hugging her body tightly and she walked with such grace it could put a model to shame.  I waited impatiently for 5:30 to come but it seemed endless the clock seemed to move slower every second, then finally the time came.  I drove to her house quickly slightly over the speed limit and I arrived after about 10 minutes.  My heart pounded in my chest for the first time I could feel my blood run through my veins I reluctantly rang the doorbell . After a minute of waiting I heard the sweetest voice in the world ask from the door,  “Who is it?” “Um it’s uhh me Bret from school.” I heard the locks turn and then the door opened.  The way she looked was indescribable, it felt as if the world stood still and an angel drifted from the heavens into her place.  “Hey Bret are you ready?” I stood there absolutely speechless but then popped into my senses again “Oh yeah um sorry you look great by the way.” “Thanks.”  “Do you mind if we go somewhere else to study?  My house isn’t the best looking in the inside.” “Sure whatever makes you feel comfortable.”  “Oh but let me run across the street to get something from my friend.” She said.   “Ok go ahead.”  She walked out into the street and I could have sworn my heart skipped a beat a car driving what seemed like 10 miles over the speed limit.  I ran into the street and pushed her out of the way.  The car tried to stop but it was to late the car hit me and I blacked out.  When I came too all I saw was lacy standing over me calling the ambulance, then I blacked out again.  When I woke up again I was in the hospital lying in bed.  I looked over and saw lacy standing over me. The first thing I said was, “Are you ok?”  “yeah.” She said “But you’re not.”  “I’ll be fine as long as you’re ok.”  She looked into my eyes and leaned close and said “Thank you so much for pushing me out of the way, you could have died but you risked your life to save me and you barely even know me, why?”  “Because I really like you, I think you’re beautiful and the people you hang around don’t see as much in you that I do.” After I spoke I shocked myself I never thought any of those words would ever leave me mouth.  She stood there speechless and surprised then she began to lean closer and closer and before I knew It our lips met, we both closed our eyes as her tongue slipped passed my lips an mine hers.  After she drew back I still had my eyes closed when I opened them she smiled at me.  “You have no idea how long I’ve waited for that.” She laughed again “I will see you tomorrow they told me that’s when they can release you I will pick you up in your car.”  “Ok see you then.”  The next morning finally came, slowly but it came.  She picked me up like she said and then told me something that sent chills down my spine.  She told me her dad is a very powerful man which means he has lots of enemies and then she told me she had been feeling as though she was being followed. “Don’t worry.” I said “ I will always be watching over you and no matter what I will find you if something bad ever happens.       \n",

      "I wasnt sure how I was gonna do it but I knew what I had to do.  Some might ask how someone could have such a strong love for someone they barley even knew, the truth is I couldn't even answer that question if I tried.  Everyone knows the saying \"The heart wants what the heart wants\", well at that moment she was what my heart desired most and I was willing to do anything to keep her. The rest of the ride to my house was in silence, for some reason I still couldnt wrap my mind around what has happened and what was happening.  We pulled up to my houes and went upstairs to my room to talk.  \"I understand if this is to much for you to handle.\" she said with a sad worried look on her face \"What do you mean?\" I asked \"You are one of the sweetest guys i've ever met and i would hate for anything bad to happen to you because of me\" she replied tears slowly falling from her eyes. \"Nothing bad is gonna happen to me\" I said grabbing her and holding her close to comfort her.  \"I'm happy being with you and I don't want to lose you over some problems between your dad and some other men and I refuse to let you leave knowing I can't be with you.\"   \n",
